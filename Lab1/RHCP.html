				<article>It's been a month since <b>Red Hot Chili Peppers</b> had fans buzzing by announcing their reunion with longtime guitarist John Frusciante, though they've kept the details of the rekindling vague with a few festival dates in 2020.However, in a new interview with Rolling Stone, drummer Chad Smith briefly discussed the RHCP in the midst of chats his upcoming visual art exhibition. “I was given strict orders for this interview: ‘DON’T TALK ABOUT THE BAND,’” he said, but went on to talk a bit about the band.

					“But, yes, John is back in the band, and everyone knows that. We’re psyched. The festivals are the only shows booked. For now, we’ll mostly be concentrating on new songs and writing a new record. We’re all real excited to make new music.”

					While the info is still a bit unclear, it seems we'll have some new RHCP music with Frusciante soon.

					Frusciante was originally in the Chili Peppers from 1988 to 1992. After a six year break, he returned in 1998 and left in 2009. Josh Klinghoffer took Frusciante’s place after his 2009 departure.
